# Conventions
  - When adding a page, you must add an entry for it in [toc.md](windows-iotcore/TOC.md) for it to appear.
  - A folder can contain more folders or `readme.md`s
  - Folder/directory names are dash-separated (e.g., `f12-tools`) and lowercase. They are used in URLs on the docs.microsoft.com site. Don't use underscores or PascalCase/camelCase.


## Other text elements

These other text elements have styling available:

* Unordered lists
* Have regular bullets
   * You can also nest bullets
   * Bullets lists should have more than one entry.
* Pretty standard

1. Ordered lists
2. Use regular ol' western-style numbering.
3. Should be used only when a list truly has order.

_________________________

Horizontal rules are available. We suggest using them sparingly to reduce clutter.
Do not combine  horizontal rules with heading tags; some already used line styles for visual hierarchy.
Also, do not combine notes (see below) in the middle of numbered lists. This messes with the numbering order.

## Displaying code

You can use inline `code` Markdown syntax (with the backticks).

Or you can display blocks of code like so:

```css
body {
	background: #fff;
}
```

## Tables

| You can     | use headers | on tables    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------:|
| Left-aligned| Unless a #  | 456          |
| Text value  | More text   | $0.00        |

## Notes

Use notes sparingly. They are blocks designed to highlight "don't-miss-it" information.

We have four different versions of notes currently styled:
- NOTE
- WARNING
- TIP
- IMPORTANT


For multi-line blockquote notes, use a > in front of each line of the notes as seen in the example below.

## Images

Images should be stored in a `media` folder and referenced with a relative path:

`![Note patterns](media/notes.png)`
