# Using WiFi Direct on your Windows 10 IoT Core device

WiFi Direct is supported on Windows 10 IoT Core devices through the use of a WiFi Direct enabled USB WiFi adapter. To make sure that WiFi Direct is enabled two things need to be true:
* the hardware of the USB WiFi adapter needs to support WiFi Direct,
* the corresponding driver of the USB WiFi adapter needs to support WiFi Direct. 

WiFi Direct provides a solution for WiFi device-to-device connectivity without the need for either a Wireless Access Point (wireless AP) to setup the connection. Take a look at the UWP APIs available in the [Windows.Devices.WiFiDirect namespace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.wifidirect.aspx) to see what you can do with WiFiDirect.

## Supported Adapters

A list of WiFi adapters that have been tested on Windows 10 IoT Core can be found on our [Supported Hardware](../learn-about-hardware/HardwareCompatList.md) page. 

## Basic sample for WiFi Direct

You can easily test the WiFi Direct functionality with the WiFi Direct UWP [sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/WiFiDirect). We will use the C# version and run the sample of two devices.

### Set up the two devices
* MinnowBoardMax (MBM) running Windows 10 IoT Core (see instructions here), with a CanaKit WiFi dongle
* Connect monitor, keyboard and mouse to the MBM
* A Windows 10 PC running the latest Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The PC (or laptop) will need to have WiFi Direct support (e.g. a Microsoft Surface)
* Install Visual Studio 2017 on your Windows 10 PC
* Clone or download the WiFi Direct UWP [sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/WiFiDirect)(root of the GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples)).
* Load the C# version of the WiFi Direct UWP sample in Visual Studio 2017

#### Run the sample on the two devices
* Compile the sample and deploy/run it on the MBM:

    * Set the "Solution Platforms" combobox to "x86"
    * Select "Remote Machine" from the "Run" dropdown
    * Start the sample on the MBM without debugging (either by pressing Ctrl-F5 or by selecting "Start Without Debugging" from the "Debug" menu)
    * You should see the WiFi Direct sample running on the monitor connected to the MBM
* Compile the sample and deploy/run it on the Windows 10 PC:
    * Set the "Solution Platforms" combobox to "x86"
    * Select "Local" from the "Run" dropdown
    * Start the sample (either F5 or Ctrl-F5)
    * You should see the WiFi Direct sample running on your Windows 10 PC

### Set up Advertiser and Connector
* On the MBM, select (1) "Advertiser" and press the "Start Advertisement" button

    * The MBM will start advertising itself on the WiFi Direct channel

        Notice the "Advertisement Status" banner at the bottom of the app.
    
* On the Windows 10 PC, select (2) "Connector" and press the "Start Watcher" button 

    * The Windows 10 PC will start scanning for available WiFi Direct connections
    * When the scanning is complete, you should see the name of your MBM in the "Discovered Devices" list

        ![Connector Configuration Screen](../media/SetupWiFiDirect/Connector01.png)

        You can see two devices listed (we're interested in "ale-mbm01"), and the "DeviceWatcher enumeration completed" message.

### Pair the devices
* On the Windows 10 PC, select the MBM ("ale-mbm01" in our example) from the "Discovered Devices" list and press the "Connect" button
* On the Windows 10 PC, press "Yes" to initiate the pairing process

* On the MBM monitor you should a message with the PIN

    ![Advertiser PIN dialog](../media/SetupWiFiDirect/Advertiser02.png)

* On the Windows 10 PC, you should see a dialog where you need to enter the PIN

### Talk on the channel
* The two devices should be connected. You should see a randomly generated device id ("hqffpzhz.ggg" in our example) on both screens in the "Connected Devices" list

    ![Advertiser Connected Device](../media/SetupWiFiDirect/Advertiser03.png)

    ![Connector Connected Device](../media/SetupWiFiDirect/Connector04.png)

* You now have a full-duplex channel (or socket) set up

    * on the MBM, select the device ("hqffpzhz.ggg") from the "Connected Devices" list
    * type a message in the "Enter a message" textbox
    * press the "Send" button
    * you should see the message being received from the Windows 10 PC
    * try sending a message from the Windows 10 PC to the MBM
