# Get the tools needed to create Windows IoT Core images

## Goals
* Download and install all the tools needed to build Windows IoT Core OEM images

## PCs and devices

* **Technician PC**: This is the PC you will be building your images on. A dedicated PC is recommended for this. This PC should have at least 15GB of free space for installing the software and for modifying IoT Core images. <p>We recommend either Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 with the latest updates. The minimum requirement is Windows 7 SP1, though this may require additional tools or workarounds for tasks such as mounting .ISO images.

* **IoT device:** A test device or board that represents all of the devices in a single model line. <p>Please see [SoCs and Custom Boards](../../learn-about-hardware/SoCsAndCustomBoards.md) for a list of supported devices.

* An **HDMI cable**, and a **monitor or TV** with a dedicated HDMI input. This will be used to verify that the image is loaded and that your apps are running properly.

## Storage
* A **microSD card**. Please note that this is dependent on the device you are using. Some devices require a microSD card, while others have onboard storage. Learn more about existing [supported storage](../../learn-about-hardware/HardwareCompatList.md#other-hardware-peripherals) options.

## Software
Here's the software you'll need to create custom OEM images using the Windows 10 IoT Core ADK Add-Ons:

**Install the following tools on your Technician PC:**

1. [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install#winADK) including at least the features shown below. You'll use these tools to create images and provisioning packages. <p>**NOTE - The version of ADK used must match the version of IoT Core Packages used below**

2. [Windows PE add-on for the ADK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install#winADK) - If you need to build image with Recovery capabilities, you will also need to separately download and install the `Windows PE add-on for the ADK`.  In previous releases, this was part of the ADK.  

3. [Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk) - `OPTIONAL`, required only if you are compiling drivers from source code.

4. [Windows 10 IoT Core Packages](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10iotcore). The .iso package adds the IoT Core packages and feature manifests used to create IoT Core images. By default, these packages are installed to **C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\MSPackages\Retail**. Install one or more of the IoT Core packages, depending on the architecture you are building an image for (ARM, ARM64, x86, x64).

5. [IoT Core ADK Add-Ons](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit/). Click **[Clone** or **Download] > Download ZIP**, and extract it to a folder on the Technician PC (for example, **C:\IoT-ADK-AddonKit**). This kit includes the sample scripts and base structures you'll use to create your image. To learn about the contents, see [What's in the Windows ADK IoT Core Add-ons](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/iot/iot-core-adk-addons).

6. [Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=708576)

7. The Board Support Package from the device manufacturer you are working with. For example, if you are using a Raspberry Pi, the BSP is located [here](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit/releases/download/v4.4/rpibsp-wm.zip). For other devices, please visit the [Windows 10 IoT Core BSP](BoardSupportPackages.md) page to download other BSPs.

8. If you are building Retail image, you will need to get a [code-signing certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/get-a-code-signing-certificate). For  kernel driver signing, Standard Code signing certificate is sufficient.  You will require an EV cert to access the [Device Update Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/service/iot/using-device-update-center) in Hardware Dev Center portal.<p> 

    **Important Note**<p>
    We recommend that you purchase your code signing certificate from a Certificate Authority listed from the link above.  Building Windows 10 IoT Core **Retail image** or image with Secure Boot enabled requires that all kernel drivers (including all drivers in the BSP that's included in the retail image) are signed with a code signing certificate with Cross Signed root.  See [Cross-Certificates for Kernel Model Code Signing](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/cross-certificates-for-kernel-mode-code-signing) and the FAQ section "Cross-Signing and SHA-256 Certificates" in [code-signing certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/get-a-code-signing-certificate).  <p> 
    As a example, if you choose to purchase through [Digicert](https://www.digicert.com/friends/sysdev/), you must choose the "Microsoft Kernel-Model Code" option in the Platform section :

Other helpful software:
    
* **A text editor** such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

* **A compression program** such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), which can uncompress Windows app packages.

* **[Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)**, which can be used to create apps in [Adding an App to an image](../Customize-Image/AddingApps.md).
* **Optional Microsoft PreBuilt FFUs** can be downloaded from Microsoft. The images are installed here: **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft IoT\FFU**.


## Other software
* **An app built for IoT Core**. This walkthrough uses the [IoT Core Default](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples/tree/develop/IoTCoreDefaultApp) app, though you can use your own.
