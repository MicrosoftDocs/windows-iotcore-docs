# An overview of Windows 10 IoT Core

## What is Windows 10 IoT Core?
Windows IoT Core is a version of Windows 10 that is optimized for smaller devices with or without a display that run on both ARM and x86/x64 devices. The Windows IoT Core documentation provides information on connecting, managing, updating, and securing your devices, and more. 

## Getting Started
To get started with Windows 10 IoT Core, we've created a [Windows 10 IoT Core Quickstarter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/tutorials/quickstarter/prototypeboards) to help you get familiar with the platform quickly. 

From there, you can continue to experiment with the platform by developing your own application or start making plans to bring your device to market - commercialize your device. To get started with commercializing, see the section on "Bring a device to market" on our [Get Started article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/getstarted).
