# An overview of Windows 10 IoT Enterprise

## What is Windows 10 IoT Enterprise?
Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is a full version of Windows 10 that delivers enterprise manageability and security to IoT solutions. It is a binary equivalent to Windows 10 Enterprise, so if you already know how Windows 10 Enterprise works, a lot of that knowledge is transferrable to Windows 10 IoT Enterprise. However, when it comes to licensing and distribution, the desktop version and IoT version differ. 

## Getting Started 
Before reaching out to an Embedded/IoT Distributor, we recommend working with one of [these devices](https://solutionsdirectory.intel.com/solutions-directory/processors/736/processors/766/processors/782/processors/788/processors/869/processors/879/processors/883/processors/888/processors/1053/processors/1058/processors/1103/processors/1107/processors/1110/processors/1117/processors/1133/processors/1135/processors/1139/processors/1141/processors/1175/processors/1192/processors/1344/processors/1348/processors/1349/processors/1371/processors/1392/processors/1729/processors/2284).  You can load your PC or recommended device with an [evaluation copy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) of Windows 10 Enterprise in order to begin prototyping right away.

In order to start your journey in manufacturing with Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, you will need to reach out to a distributor from [this list](http://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Windows_IoT_Distributor_Information.pdf). 

## Fixed purpose devices 

> [TIP]
> See your licensing agreement for complete guidance on all Windows 10 IoT Enterprise usage scenarios.

The Windows 10 IoT Enterprise edition is licensed to allow you to build fixed purpose devices like Thin Clients, ATM Machines, Point-of-Sale Terminals, Industrial Automation Systems, etc.  There are specific allowances and restrictions in the license agreement. 

In general a fixed purpose device differs from a general purpose device in the following ways:  
* The device is locked down to a single application or fixed set of applications through the Assigned Access or Shell Launcher features.  
* The device powers-on immediately to the experience when recieved by the end-customer. This is achieved by configuring the device image to skip the normal Windows out-of-box experiences.
* Keyboards, USB ports, and device policies are locked down to constrain the device to be used only in its fixed purpose.  
* The OEM licenses the device to the user with the software attached to the device as a complete product and passes through specific Windows terms in their own agreements.

## Differences between Windows 10 IoT Core and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise
While Windows 10 IoT Core and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise are similar in name, there are differences in what they offer as well as what they support. Below is a feature list that highlights edition differences.
