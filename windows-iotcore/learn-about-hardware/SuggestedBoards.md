# Suggested Boards and SoCs

## Windows 10 IoT Core Development Devices
While we [suggest a few boards to get started on](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/getstarted/prototype/selectdevice), if you want to work with something else for prototyping or development, we have hundreds of different devices in the ecosystem that you can use to prototype or commercialize your idea with.

## Microsoft-enabled SoCs
Microsoft works alongside Broadcom, Intel, and Qualcomm to verify support for Windows 10 IoT Core on several of the silicon vendors' SoC. These IoT Core-powered SoCs are used in hundreds of different devices that you can ues to prorotype and commercialize your idea with.
