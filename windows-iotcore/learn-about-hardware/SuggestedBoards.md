# Suggested Boards and SoCs

## Microsoft-enabled SoCs
Microsoft works alongside Broadcom, Intel, and Qualcomm to verify support for Windows 10 IoT Core on several of the silicon vendors' SoC. These IoT Core-powered SoCs are used in hundreds of different devices that you can use to prototype and commercialize your idea with. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must create your own images and not use the provided images below if you plan to commercialize your device.
