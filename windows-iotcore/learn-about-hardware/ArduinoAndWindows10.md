# Arduino and Windows 10

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Windows 10 IoT team is no longer actively maintaining Arduino.

Arduino and Windows 10 work together to help you make amazing projects - get started by clicking one of the links below. Our technologies support the Arduino Uno and Mega, as well as the new Arduino 101.

## Arduino Wiring for Windows 10 IoT Core Devices

To enable the use of the familiar [Arduino Wiring](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage) language on IoT Core devices, a Visual Studio project template for Arduino Wiring is provided. The Arduino Wiring project template enables developing, deploying and debugging Arduino Wiring sketches on supported IoT Core devices.

## Windows Remote Arduino

Windows Remote Arduino is an open-source Windows Runtime library which allows Makers to control an Arduino through a Bluetooth, USB, Wi-Fi, or Ethernet connection. It enables developers to include Arduino sensors in their Windows projects, or even offload computationally expensive work from an Arduino to Windows. The Windows Remote Arduino library can be used with any WinRT languages (C++/CX, C# and JavaScript).

Windows Virtual Shields for Arduino is an open-source library primarily for the Arduino UNO which communicates with an open-source Universal Windows application running on all Windows 10 devices, including Windows Lumia phones. The library exposes Lumia phones' sensors and capabilities to the an Arduino Wiring Sketch.
