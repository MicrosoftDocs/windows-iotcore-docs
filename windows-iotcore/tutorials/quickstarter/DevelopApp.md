# Get Started with Windows 10 IoT Core

Now that you have a working device with the default app running, you'll want to take your device to the next level by developing and deploying an app on your device. To get this working quickly, we recommend starting with the [Hello Blinky sample](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-iotcore-samples/tree/develop/Samples/HelloBlinky) or [any of our other samples](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/samples). But if you're ready to deploy your own app, we've provided helpful links below.

Once you've deployed your app - congratulations, you've finished this quickstarter! Continue to play around or, if you have a few ideas bouncing around in your head, check out or documentation on commercializing with Windows 10 IoT.
