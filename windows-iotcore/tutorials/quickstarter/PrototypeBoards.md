# Suggested Prototype Boards

## Windows 10 IoT Core Development Devices
Below you'll find boards we suggest to help you get started with Windows 10 IoT Core. These boards offer a Full Flash Update (FFU) image, making prototyping faster with a ready-made image and making the process of flashing Windows 10 IoT Core a breeze.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must create your own images and not use the provided images below if you plan to commercialize your device.

> [!NOTE]
> The Raspberry Pi 3B+ has limited compatability with Windows 10 IoT Core. Please view the [release notes](../../release-notes/insider/rpi3bp.md) for more information. For a more complete Windows 10 IoT Core experience, please use a Raspberry Pi 3B, DragonBoard, Up2 Board or NXP device.
