# An Overview of Accessibility for Windows IoT

## Introduction
In addition to development, design, and testing, accessibility is another concept to take into account when publishing
applications or manufacturing devices. Accessibility enables all people to leverage all of the functionalities your applications or devices offer, regardless of a user's abilities.

To ensure that applications and devices leveraging Windows IoT products offer accessibility-ready features and experiences,
we've put together an overview on best practices and important considerations.

## Common Accessibility Bugs
When it comes to designing and developing with accessibility in mind, successful execution requires awareness and preparation.
Accessibility should be considered initially when technical specifications are decided on. It's also helpful to keep in mind common accessibility bugs that often make a big difference when implemented.

* **Colors and contrast**: Don't convey important information through the use of color alone.

* **Colors and contrast**: Provide a minimum default contrast of 4.5:1. You can find this ratio using a color contrast analyzer ([download here](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/)) or any other color contrast tool available online.

* **Keyboard accessibility**: Keyboard focus needs to be clearly visible, with required contrast and colors. The tab/arrow path through the UI must be intuitive.

* **Programmatic accessibility**: Use Windows desktop tools to learn about programmatic representation.

## Accessibility in UWP apps
The UWP team at Microsoft has put together a comprehensive guide on accessiblity for UWP app design and development. For your convenience, we've included the list below, but you can also learn more by reading their [Usability in UWP apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/usability/).
