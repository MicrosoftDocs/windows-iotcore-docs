# An overview of Windows Server IoT 2019

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Containers are supported for commercial deployments on Windows Server, Windows IoT Server, Windows IoT Enterprise and Windows IoT Core.  As of Windows October Update 2018 (Build 17763), Windows Containers can only be used with Windows Enterprise and Professional for dev/test purposes.

## What is Windows Server IoT 2019?
Windows Server IoT 2019 is a full version of Windows Server 2019 that delivers enterprise manageability and security to IoT solutions. Windows Server IoT 2019 shares all the benefits of the world-wide Windows ecosystem. It is a binary equivalent to Windows Server 2019, so you can use the same familiar development and management tools that you use on your general-purpose servers. However, when it comes to licensing and distribution, the general-purpose version and IoT versions differ.  Windows Server IoT 2019 is only licensed through the OEM channel under special dedicated use rights.

## Fixed purpose devices 

> [!TIP]
> See your licensing agreement for complete guidance on all Windows Server IoT 2019 usage scenarios. If you do not have this licensing agreement, ask the OEM you work with for the commercial agreement.

Windows Server is well known as the server operating system used by small businesses and enterprises world-wide. What is less well known is that for years, Windows Server has also powered many dedicated solutions in retail, manufacturing, healthcare, and more. Windows Server IoT 2019 allows you to build fixed purpose solutions with specific allowances and restrictions in the license agreement.

## Long-term Servicing Channel (LTSC)

This is the release model you’re already familiar with, formerly called the “Long-Term Servicing Branch”, where a new major version of Windows Server is released every two to three years. Users are entitled to five years of mainstream support and five years of extended support. This channel is appropriate for systems that require a longer servicing option and functional stability. Deployments of Windows Server IoT 2019 and earlier versions of Windows Server will not be affected by the new Semi-Annual Channel releases. The Long-Term Servicing Channel will continue to receive security and non-security updates, but it will not receive the new features and functionality.
