# Hack the Home
A suite of open-source tools designed to help you make your home start working for you.

## Featured Projects
* [Security Camera](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/windows-iot/security-camera-579b7f?ref=platform&ref_id=4087_trending___&offset=24)
  * The security camera project uses Windows 10 IoT Core. A PiR Motion Sensor detects movement and triggers the camera accordingly, automatically
    uploading the photos to OneDrive. This project utilizes the [USB camera](https://github.com/ms-iot/usb-camera), [OneDrive Connector](https://github.com/ms-iot/onedrive-connector), and [Motion Sensor](https://github.com/ms-iot/pir-sensor) components.
* [Connected Clock Radio](https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/windows-iot/connected-clock-radio-85c9fc?ref=platform&ref_id=4087_trending___&offset=32)
  * An internet-connected clock radio device with a Pi-powered LCD screen to display what's currently playing. This project utilizes the [TextDisplay](https://github.com/ms-iot/TextDisplay) and [Universal Media Engine](https://github.com/ms-iot/UniversalMediaEngine) components.
