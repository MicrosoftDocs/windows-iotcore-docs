# Windows Device Portal
   The Windows Device Portal (WDP) lets you configure and manage your device remotely over your local network.
   The main features are documented on the [Windows Device Portal overview page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal)

![Device Portal Home](../media/deviceportal/deviceportal.png)

> [!WARNING]
> Live kernel debug is currently failing for ARM devices. We are working to get this fixed.

## Shared Documentation
WDP is a developer tool shared among all Windows 10 devices. Each product has its own unique features, but the core functionality is the same.
Documentation for the main features are found on the [Windows Device Portal overview page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal). The rest of the documentation below will be IoT specific.

## Set up
1. Connect your board to the internet

    To get WDP up and running, you first need to connect your device to your network.

2. Find your device in IoT Dashboard and connect. Click on the ellipses under the "Actions" column.

   ![IoTDashboard View Devices](../media/deviceportal/Dashboard-Action.gif)

   Enter the IP address into your browser. Add :8080 onto the end.
   ![Browser IP](../media/DevicePortal/browser_ip.png)
    
3. Enter your credentials
    Unless changed, the default credentials are:

    Username: `Administrator`
    Password: `p@ssw0rd`
    
## IoT specific features

### Apps
Provides install/uninstall functionality for AppX packages and bundles on your device.
![App list](../media/DevicePortal/AppList.png)

IoT Core is unique in that it only allows one foreground app to run at one time. The app list is modified to ensure that this is the case. Under the **STARTUP** column, you can select as many background applications to start by default, but can only set one foreground application.  

### App File Explorer

The app file explorer shows the directories that your apps can access.

* CameraRoll is shared among all apps
* Documents is shared among all apps
* LocalAppData contains folders specific to each app. This folder will be the same name as your app and other apps cannot access it.

### Debugging

#### Kernel dumps
![Debugging with kernel dumps](../media/DevicePortal/Debug1.png)

Any system crashes will automatically be logged and available to view through the web management tool.  You can then download the kernel dump and try to figure out what's going on.

#### Process dumps
![Debugging with process dumps](../media/DevicePortal/Debug2.png)

This is similar to Live kernel dumps, but for the user mode processes. 
Clicking the **download** button will cause a 'minidump', and the entire state of that process will be downloaded. This is good for debugging hanging processes.

#### Kernel crash settings

### Bluetooth
This page shows you all the bluetooth paired devices and all the devices which are discoverable. To pair with another Bluetooth device, put the device in pairing mode and wait for it to appear in the available devices list.  
![Bluetooth device list](../media/DevicePortal/Bluetooth.png)

Click on **Pair link** to pair the device. If the device requires a PIN for pairing, it will pop-up a message box displaying the PIN. Once the device is paired, it will show up in the Paired devices list. You can un-pair the device by clicking on **Remove**. 

Once you navigate to the Bluetooth page, your device will be discoverable by other devices. You can also find it from your PC/Phone and pair it from there.

More information on bluetooth can be found on the [bluetooth page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=823223).

### IoT Onboarding

IoT Onboarding provides support for configuring an IoT device's Wi-Fi connectivity options.

**Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)**
Internet Connection Sharing allows you to share the Internet access of your device with other devices connected to your device over the Wi-Fi SoftAP.
To use this feature, your Windows 10 IoT Device needs to have access to the internet (e.g. through a wired LAN connection).  In 'Connectivity->Onboarding->SoftAP settings' click 'enable' and set SSID name and password.  Then in 'Connectivity->Internet connection sharing' for 'access point adapter' select "Microsoft Wi-FI Direct Virtual Adapter #2" and for 'shared network adapter' select your your wired ethernet adapter.  Finally, click 'start shared access.'  Once started, connect a separate Wi-Fi enabled device to the SoftAP on your Windows 10 IoT device.  After a connection is established your separate Wi-Fi enabled device will be able to connect to the internet through your Windows 10 IoT device.

> [!NOTE]
> ICS is disabled when a Wi-Fi profile exists on the device. 
>For example, ICS will be disabled if you connect to a Wi-Fi access point and check “Create profile (auto re-connect)”.

**SoftAP Settings**
The SoftAP Settings allow you to control whether or not your device's SoftAP is enabled.  It also provides a means for configuring your SoftAP's SSID and the WPA2-PSK key which are necessary to connect the SoftAP from another device.

**AllJoyn Onboarding Settings**
The AllJoyn Onboarding Settings allow you to control whether or not your device's Wi-Fi connection can configured through your device's AllJoyn Onboarding Producer.  When a separate device running an AllJoyn Onboarding Consumer application connects to your Windows 10 IoT SoftAP, the AllJoyn Onboarding Consumer application can be used to configure your IoT device's Wi-Fi adapter.  When enabled, the AllJoyn Onboarding Producer app (IoTOnboarding) uses the ECDHE_NULL authentication method. 

> [!NOTE]
> To use AllJoyn Onboarding with Windows 10 IoT builds 10.0.14393 or earlier requires an update to the <strong>IotOnboarding</strong> 
sample which may be [downloaded here](https://github.com/ms-iot/samples).

![Onboarding onto AllJoyn](../media/DevicePortal/OnboardingAllJoyn.png)
![Onboarding onto ICS](../media/DevicePortal/OnboardingICS.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Access point adapter is the WiFi adapter that act as a WiFi access point (it usually has an IP address like 192.168.137.1).
> Shared network adapter is the adapter that connects to Internet (e.g.: Ethernet adapter).

![Onboard onto Soft AP](../media/DevicePortal/OnboardingSoftAP.png)

> [!NOTE]
> SoftAP SSID will be automatically prefixed by "AJ_" if AllJoyn onboarding is enabled and postfixed with the MAC address of the Wifi 
> adapter. The SoftAP passphrase must be between 8 and 63 ASCII characters.


### TPM configuration
The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a cryptographic coprocessor including capabilities for random number generation, secure generation of cryptographic keys and limitation of their use. It also includes capabilities such as remote attestation and sealed storage. To learn about the TPM and security on IoT Core, visit the [Building secure devices](../secure-your-device/BuildingSecureDevices.md) page and the [TPM](../secure-your-device/TPM.md) page.

### Remote
The Windows IoT Remote Server allows users to see what their device is displaying without connecting a physical monitor to the keyboard.


## Additional Information 

### Changing the default port
 
1. Launch powershell and [connect to your device.](../connect-your-device/PowerShell.md)
2. Download [TakeRegistryOwnership](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-utilities/tree/master/TakeRegistryOwnership) tool, build it, and copy it to your device. 
3. Take ownership of the registry key for the service by running

        .\TakeRegistryOwnership.exe MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\webmanagement\service

4. Set the desired port by modifying the registry settings 

        reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\webmanagement\service /v HttpPort /t REG_DWORD /d <your port number>
        
5. Restart the WebManagement sevice by running following or by restarting the device

        net stop webmanagement ; net start webmanagement

### Using HTTPS 

If you want to use HTTPS, first take the ownership of the registry key as described in previous section and set the HttpsPort and EncryptionMode registry keys as below and then restart the webmanagement service

        reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\webmanagement\service /v EncryptionMode /t REG_DWORD /d 0x3 /f
        reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\webmanagement\service /v HttpsPort /t REG_DWORD /d <your port number> /f
        net stop webmanagement ; net start webmanagement

### Provisoning Device Portal with a custom SSL certificate

In the Windows 10 Creators Update, the Windows Device Portal added a way for device administrators to install a custom certificate for use in HTTPS communication.

To learn more, [read the documentation under the Windows Device Portal docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal-ssl).
