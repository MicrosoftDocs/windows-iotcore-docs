The purpose of this application is not only to provide you with a friendly shell to interact with when you first boot up Windows 10 IoT Core, but we have open-sourced the code for this application [here](http://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-iotcore-samples/tree/develop/Samples/IoTCoreDefaultApp/CS) so that you can plug and play with these features on your own custom application(s).

This article will give you a rundown of the different features that the Windows 10 IoT Core Default App offers as well as how you can leverage these different features for your own applications.

## Leveraging the IoT Core Default App 

/*Duane, can you take a first crack at this? Specifically about how to take parts of the IoT Core Default App and use them for your own application*/

## Start Menu - Play

The Start Menu is where most plug and play features live.

### Weather
Using data from the National Weather Service, the weather app renders weather information in your current location.

### Web Browser
The web browser allows you to pull up most sites from the web.

### Music
The music player will play MP3 and WAV files from the **Music Library**, that can be accessed via the [Windows Device Portal](../manage-your-device/DevicePortal.md).  To upload files to the music player, you will need to navigate to the Windows Device Portal, click on the "Apps" dropdown, navigate to "File Explorer", select "Music" and upload your files from there.

/*Could you also take a crack at how people can leverage the app launch feature and add their own apps to it? If that makes sense?*

The GitHub tile will take you to where our open-source code for the Windows 10 IoT Core Default App is.

## Start Menu - Windows Device Portal
