# Setup a default app
Here you'll learn the ways to set your application as the default application. The default application is the one that is launched when the system boots.  

## Runtime options

During development / experimental phases, you can change the default app by following means.

### Using Windows Device Portal

You can click on **Startup** column corresponding to the app.

### Using the shell

Steps to set the default app using the shell 

1. Connect to the device via [Powershell](../connect-your-device/PowerShell.md)

2. List the applications installed using `iotstartup list`

3. Note the appid for the application you want to make as default and set it using `iotstartup add headed <appid>`. For headless app, you should use `iotstartup add headless <appid>`.


## Build time option

For large deployments, you can achieve this using provisioning package

You can specify the StartupApp/Default setting in the WCD during the provisioning package creation.

See [Appx.IoTCoreDefaultApp](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit/tree/master/Source-arm/Packages/Appx.IoTCoreDefaultApp/customizations.xml) as an example. You can get the Application User Model ID (AUMID) of an appx using [GetAppxInfo tool](https://github.com/ms-iot/iot-adk-addonkit/tree/master/Tools/GetAppxInfo.exe).

## How to configure "Home" key

Windows 10 IoT Anniversary Update (1607) provides shell support for bringing the default application window to the foreground when another application is currently running.
