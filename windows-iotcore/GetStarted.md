# Get started with Windows 10 IoT Core

Creating your own device is exciting, but we understand that it can also be intimidating. The resources below will help you on your prototype or commercialization journey. 

Have questions along the way? Please work with your Microsoft contact or post questions on our [Windows 10 IoT forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/home?forum=WindowsIoT).

## Bring a device to market

Commercialization, or bringing a device to market, is a much more advanced process that involves more moving parts and people than just prototyping a device on your own time. Commercialization requires a number of steps to ensure that your devices, wherever they are in the world, can receive updates, are as secure as possible, and are compliant.
