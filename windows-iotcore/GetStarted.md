## Bring a device to market

Commercialization, or the process of bringing a device to market, involves more moving parts and people than just prototyping a device on your own time. Commercialization requires a number of steps to ensure that your devices, wherever they are in the world, can receive updates, are as secure as possible, and are compliant.
