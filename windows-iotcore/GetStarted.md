# Get Started with Windows 10 IoT Core

Creating your own device is exciting. But at the same time, we understand that it can also be intimidating. If you aren't familiar with Windows 10 IoT Core, we highly recommend that you start out with our Quickstarter below before diving into the deep end. On the other hand, if you're ready to go with Windows 10 IoT Core, jump down to the "Bring a device to market" section. 

Have questions along the way? Please work with your Microsoft contact or post questions on our [Windows 10 IoT forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/home?forum=WindowsIoT).
