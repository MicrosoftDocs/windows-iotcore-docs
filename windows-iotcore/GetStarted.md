# Get Started with Windows 10 IoT Core

Creating your own device is exciting. But at the same time, we understand that it can also be intimidating. Before diving straight into bringing your device to market – what we like to call “commercialization” – it’s good to get a feel for this platform by building a prototype with Windows 10 IoT Core. 
 
We have a number of devices that will help you get started with prototyping. We have many more recommendations once you’re ready to commercialize, but for now, it’s important to get Windows 10 IoT Core running – especially if this is your first time. 

If you're already comfortable with this domain, take a look at all of the different devices you can work with or, if you have certain specifications for your device, there are also options to have different companies build boards for you.

Have questions along the way? Please work with your Microsoft contact or post questions on our [Windows 10 IoT forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/home?forum=WindowsIoT).
