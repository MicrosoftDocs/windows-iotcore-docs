# Get started with Windows 10 IoT Core

Creating your own device is exciting, but we understand that it can also be intimidating. The resources below will help you on your prototype or commercialization journey.

Have questions along the way? Please work with your Microsoft contact or post questions on our [Windows 10 IoT forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/home?forum=WindowsIoT).

## What is Windows 10 IoT?

## Windows 10 IoT pricing

| Purpose | Pricing |
| ------- | ------- |
| Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) for commercialization | Small fee per device with access to 10 years of support, update control and Device Health Attestation (DHA). Learn more [here](/windows-hardware/manufacture/iot/iotcoreservicesoverview). |
| Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) for commercialization | Free, but you will not get access to 10 years of support, update control, or DHA. You will also need to sign our commercialization agreement. Request it [here](https://www.aka.ms/SAC-agreement).

## Prototype a device

Before attempting to manufacture a device, it's best to first try and prototype a device with Windows 10 IoT Core. That way, you can understand what features you'll need and what configurations you'll want when it's time to manufacture.

| 2. Flash a prototype image | Go to our tutorial sections to learn how to flash prototype images onto your selected device(s). |
| [3. Install your app](/windows/iot-core/develop-your-app/appinstaller) | Learn how to install your app using different tools. |
| [4. Deploy your app](/windows/iot-core/develop-your-app/appdeployment) | Learn how to deploy an app using Visual Studio. |

## Bring a device to market

Commercialization, or the process of bringing a device to market, involves more moving parts and people than just prototyping a device on your own time. Commercialization requires a number of steps to ensure that your devices, wherever they are in the world, can receive updates, are as secure as possible, and are compliant.

Start with the manufacturing guide that works best for you, depending on which version of Windows 10 IoT you're looking to use.
