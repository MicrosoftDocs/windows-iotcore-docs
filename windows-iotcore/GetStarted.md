# Get Started with Windows 10 IoT Core

Creating your own device is exciting. But at the same time, we understand that it can also be intimidating. If you aren't familiar with Windows 10 IoT Core, we highly recommend that you start out with our [Windows 10 IoT Core Quickstarter](tutorials/Tutorials.md). On the other hand, if you already have experience with Windows 10 IoT Core, you can start learning about [the commercialization process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/commercialize-your-device/oemlicenserequirements) (with more details below). 

Have questions along the way? Please work with your Microsoft contact or post questions on our [Windows 10 IoT forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/home?forum=WindowsIoT).

## What is Windows 10 IoT?

Want to learn more about our two offerings, Windows 10 IoT Enterprise and Windows 10 IoT Core? We've created documentation for you to learn more about what each product has to offer.

## Bring a device to market

Commercializing, or bringing a device to market, is on a different level from tinkering or prototyping. Commercializing requires a number of steps to ensure that your device - wherever they are in the world - can receive updates, are secure, and are compliant. 

Because this is a path that goes beyond educational or personal/non-commercial purposes, we ask that you follow the steps and complete the requirements listed in the documentation below.
