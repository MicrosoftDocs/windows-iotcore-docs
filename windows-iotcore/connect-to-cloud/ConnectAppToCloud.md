# Connect your app to the cloud

This step-by-step guide will allow you to familiarize yourself with Windows 10
IoT Core, set up your device and create your first application that
connects to Azure IoT Hub.

## Step 1: Prepare your device

You can find instructions on how to prepare your device on the [Get Started Page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/getstarted) 
Make sure you [provision the TPM of your device](../connect-to-cloud/ConnectDeviceToCloud.md)

## Step 2: Install Visual Studio 2017 and tools

Install [Visual Studio
2017](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845271). You
can install any edition of Visual Studio, including the free Community edition.

Make sure to select the **Universal Windows App Development Tools**, the
component required for writing apps Windows 10:

You can install the extension from the [VS Gallery](https://aka.ms/azure-iot-hub-vs-cs-vs-gallery).

## Use the Connected Services for Azure IoT Hub to connect to Azure IoT Hub

Follow the instructions from the [Connected Services tool](https://aka.ms/azure-iot-hub-vs-2017-cs-vs-gallery) to connect your project to Azure IoT Hub. The tool will generate two functions, `SendDeviceToCloudMessageAsync` and `ReceiveCloudToDeviceMessageAsync` that you can invoke anywhere in your app. You can modify these functions as you see fit.
